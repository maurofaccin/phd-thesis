  abstract = {The folding/unfolding kinetics of a three-dimensional lattice protein
	was studied using a simple statistical mechanical model for protein
	folding that we developed earlier. We calculated a characteristic
	relaxation rate for the free energy profile starting from a completely
	unfolded structure (or native structure) that is assumed to be associated
	with a folding rate (or an unfolding rate). The chevron plot of these
	rates as a function of the inverse temperature was obtained for four
	lattice proteins, namely, proteins a1, a2, b1, and b2, in order to
	investigate the dependency of the folding and unfolding rates on
	their native structures and amino acid sequences. Proteins a1 and
	a2 fold to the same native conformation, but their amino acid sequences
	differ. The same is the case for proteins b1 and b2, but their native
	conformation is different from that of proteins a1 and a2. However,
	the chevron plots of proteins a1 and a2 are very similar to each
	other, and those of proteins b1 and b2 differ considerably. Since
	the contact orders of proteins b1 and b2 are identical, the differences
	in their kinetics should be attributed to the amino acid sequences
	and consequently to the interactions between the amino acid residues.
	A detailed analysis revealed that long-range interactions play an
	important role in causing the difference in the folding rates. The
	chevron plots for the four proteins exhibit a chevron rollover under
	both strongly folding and strongly unfolding conditions. The slower
	relaxation time on the broad and flat free energy surfaces of the
	unfolding conformations is considered to be the main origin of the
	chevron rollover, although the free energy surfaces have features
	that are rather complicated to be described in detail here. Finally,
	in order to concretely examine the relationship between changes in
	the free energy profiles and the chevron plots, we illustrate some
	examples of single amino acid substitutions that increase the folding
	rate. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We introduce a simple procedure to analyze the temperature dependence
	of the folding and unfolding rates of two-state proteins. We start
	from the simple transition-state-like rate expression: k = D(eff)exp(-DeltaG(TS)/RT),
	in which upper and lower bounds for the intra-chain effective diffusion
	coefficient (D(eff)) are obtained empirically using the timescales
	of elementary processes in protein folding. From the changes in DeltaG(TS)
	as a function of temperature, we calculate enthalpies and heat capacities
	of activation, together with the more elusive entropies of activation.
	We then estimate the conformational entropy of the transition state
	by extrapolation to the temperature at which the solvation entropy
	vanishes by cancellation between polar and apolar terms. This approach
	is based on the convergence temperatures for the entropy of solvating
	apolar (approximately 385 K) and polar groups (approximately 335
	K), the assumption that the structural properties of the transition
	state are somewhere in between the unfolded and folded states, and
	the established relationship between observed heat capacity and solvent
	accessibility.1 To circumvent the lack of structural information
	about transition states, we use the empirically determined heat capacities
	of activation as constraints to identify the extreme values of the
	transition state conformational entropy that are consistent with
	experiment. The application of this simple approach to six two-state
	folding proteins for which there is temperature-dependent data available
	in the literature provides important clues about protein folding.
	For these six proteins, we obtain an average equilibrium cost in
	conformational entropy of -4.3 cal x mol(-1)K(-1)per residue, which
	is in close agreement to previous empirical and computational estimates
	of the same quantity. Furthermore, we find that all these proteins
	have a conformationally diverse transition state, with more than
	half of the conformational entropy of the unfolded state. In agreement
	with predictions from theory and computer simulations, the transition
	state signals the change from a regime dominated by loss in conformational
	entropy to one driven by the gain in stabilization free energy (i.e.,
	including protein interactions and solvation effects). Moreover,
	the height of the barrier is determined by how much stabilization
	free energy is realized at that point, which is related to the relative
	contribution of local versus non-local interactions. A remarkable
	observation is that the fraction of conformational entropy per residue
	that is present in the transition state is very similar for the six
	proteins in this study. Based on this commonality, we propose that
	the observed change in thermodynamic regime is connected to a change
	in the pattern of structure formation: from one driven by formation
	of pairwise interactions to one dominated by coupling of the networks
	of interactions involved in forming the protein core. In this framework,
	the barrier to two-state folding is crossed when the folding protein
	reaches a ``critical native density'' that allows expulsion of remaining
	interstitial water and consolidation of the core. The principle of
	critical native density should be general for all two-state proteins,
	but can accommodate different folding mechanisms depending on the
	particularities of the structure and sequence.},

	levels, and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from diverse species
	verifies that myotrophin/V-1 is a highly conserved gene. Northern
	analysis indicates wide-spread expression of a single human transcript,
	and examination of mRNA distribution in 50 human tissues by dot blot

  abstract = {Transient thermal unfolding of ubiquitin is investigated using nonlinear
	infrared spectroscopy after a nanosecond laser temperature jump (T-jump).
	The abrupt change in the unfolding free energy surface and the ns
	time resolution allow us to observe a fast response on ns to micros
	time-scales, which we attribute to downhill unfolding, before a cross-over
	to ms kinetics. The downhill unfolding by a sub-population of folded
	proteins is induced through a shift of the barrier toward the native
	state. By adjusting the T-jump width, the effect of the initial (T(i))
	and final (T(f)) temperature on the unfolding dynamics can be separated.
	From the amplitude of the fast downhill unfolding, the fractional
	population prepared at the unfolding transition state is obtained.
	This population increases with both T(i) and with T(f). A two-state
	kinetic analysis of the ms refolding provides thermodynamic information
	about the barrier height. By a combination of the fast and slow unfolding
	and folding parameters, a quasi-two-state kinetic analysis is performed
	to calculate the time-dependent population changes of the folded
	state. This calculation coincides with the experimentally obtained
	population changes at low temperature but deviations are found in
	the T-jump from 67 to 78 degrees C. Using temperature-dependent barrier
	height changes, a temperature Phi value analysis is performed. The
	result shows a decreasing trend of Phi(T) with temperature, which
	indicates an increase of the heterogeneity of the transition state.
	We conclude that ubiquitin unfolds along a well-defined pathway at
	low temperature which expands with increasing temperature to include

	the peptide backbone upon protein folding was investigated experimentally
	and by computational analysis. Experimentally, two different pairs
	of mutants of a 33 amino acid peptide corresponding to the leucine
	zipper region of GCN4 were used for high-sensitivity microcalorimetric
	analysis. Each pair of mutants differed only by having alanine or
	glycine at a specific solvent-exposed position under conditions in
	which the differences in stability could be attributed to differences
	in the conformational entropy of the unfolded state. The mutants
	studied were characterized by different stabilities but had identical
	heat capacity changes of unfolding (delta Cp), identical solvent-related
	entropies of unfolding (delta Ssolv), and identical enthalpies of
	unfolding (delta H) at equivalent temperatures. Accordingly, the
	differences in stability between the different mutants could be attributed
	to differences in conformational entropy. The computational studies
	were aimed at generating the energy profile of backbone conformations
	as a function of the main chain dihedral angles phi and phi. The
	energy profiles permit a direct calculation of the probability distribution
	of different conformers and therefore of the conformational entropy
	of the backbone. The experimental results presented in this paper
	indicate that the presence of the methyl group in alanine reduces
	the conformational entropy of the peptide backbone by 2.46 +/- 0.2
	cal/K. mol with respect to that of glycine, consistent with a 3.4-fold
	reduction in the number of allowed conformations in the alanine-containing
	peptides. Similar results were obtained from the energy profiles.
	The computational analysis also indicates that the addition of further
	carbon atoms to the side chain had only a small effect as long as
	the side chains were unbranched at position beta. A further reduction
	with respect to Ala of only 0.61 and 0.81 cal/K. mol in the backbone
	entropy was obtained for leucine and lysine, respectively. beta-branching
	(Val) produces the largest decrease in conformational entropy (1.92
	cal/K.mol less than Ala). Finally, the backbone entropy change associated
	with the unfolding of an alpha-helix is 6.51 cal/K.mol for glycine.
	These and previous results have allowed a complete estimation of

	less than 2{\%} for the stability). Folding is thus highly sensitive
	to little changes in protein energetics, but at the same time the
	folding properties of natural proteins are remarkably homogeneous.
	These results suggest that evolution has selected a small subset

	of denaturation (m-value), which do not ordinarily apply for globular
	proteins. We show how the parameters for the ``coarse-grained'' description
	in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed
	folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate
	the ideas, we present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide

	effect that single point mutations exert on the experimentally observed
	folding behavior, we speculate that natural repeat proteins are ``poised''
	at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics

	62-residue alpha+beta protein expected to fold slowly in a two-state
	fashion, folds in microseconds (i.e., from tau = 33 micros at 310
	K to tau = 1.7 micros at 355 K). Thermodynamic analyses of gpW reveal
	probe dependent thermal denaturation, complex coupling between two
	denaturing agents, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram
	characteristic of folding over a negligible thermodynamic folding
	barrier. The free energy surface analysis of gpW folding kinetics
	also produces a marginal folding barrier of about thermal energy
	( RT) at the denaturation midpoint. From these results we conclude
	that gpW folds in the downhill regime and is close to the global
	downhill limit. This protein seems to be poised toward downhill folding
	by a loosely packed hydrophobic core with low aromatic content, large
	stabilizing contributions from local interactions, and abundance
	of positive charges on the native surface. These special features,
	together with a complex functional role in bacteriophage lambda assembly,
	suggest that gpW has been engineered to fold downhill by natural

  abstract = {Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure the temperature
	dependence of the absolute heat capacity of the 35-residue subdomain
	of the villin headpiece, a protein that folds in 5 mus and is therefore
	assumed to have a small free-energy barrier separating folded and
	unfolded states. To obtain an estimate of the barrier height from
	the calorimetric data, two models, a variable-barrier model and an
	Ising-like model, were used to fit the heat capacity in excess of
	the folded state over the temperature range 15-125 degrees C. The
	variable-barrier model is based on an empirical mathematical form
	for the density of states, with four adjustable parameters and the
	enthalpy (H) as a reaction coordinate. The Ising-like model is based
	on the inter-residue contact map of the X-ray structure with exact
	enumeration of approximately 10(5) possible conformations, with two
	adjustable parameters in the partition function, and either the fraction
	of native contacts (Q) or the number of ordered residues (P) as reaction
	coordinates. The variable-barrier model provides an excellent fit
	to the data and yields a barrier height at the folding temperature
	ranging from 0.4 to 1.1 kcal mol(-1), while the Ising-like model
	provides a less good fit and yields barrier heights of 2.3 +/- 0.1
	kcal mol(-1) and 2.1 +/- 0.1 kcal mol(-1) for the Q and P reaction
	coordinates, respectively. In both models, the barrier to folding
	increases with increasing temperature. Assuming a sufficiently large
	activation energy for diffusion on the free-energy surfaces, both
	models are consistent with the observation of a temperature-independent
	folding rate in previously published laser temperature-jump experiments.
	Analysis of this kinetic data, using an approximate form for the
	pre-exponential factor of Kramers theory and the 70 ns relaxation
	time for the fast phase that precedes the unfolding/refolding relaxation
	to determine the diffusion coefficient, results in a barrier height
	of 1.6 +/- 0.3 kcal mol-1 for an unspecified reaction coordinate.
	Although no independent test of the validity of the H, Q, or P reaction
	coordinates is given, the barrier-height estimates obtained with
	the three reaction coordinates are in quite good agreement with the
	value derived from a Kramers analysis of the kinetics that makes
	no assumptions about the reaction coordinate. However, the higher
	estimates obtained using Q or P appear more consistent with the finding
	of barrier-crossing kinetics of a villin mutant that folds in 700
	ns, corresponding to a 1.3 kcal mol-1 reduction in the folding barrier
	relative to wild-type. All of the results suggest that the free-energy
	barrier to folding is sufficiently low that it should be possible
	to engineer this protein or find solution conditions that would eliminate
	the barrier to create the ``downhill'' folding scenario of Wolynes
	and Onuchic.},

  abstract = {The discovery that the protease from the human immunodeficiency virus
	(HIV) belongs to the aspartic protease family has generated renewed
	interest in this class of proteins. In this paper, the interactions
	of endothiapepsin, an aspartic proteinase from the fungus Endothia
	parasitica, with the inhibitor pepstatin A have been studied by high-sensitivity
	calorimetric techniques. These experiments have permitted a complete
	characterization of the temperature and pH-dependence of the binding
	energetics. The binding reaction is characterized by negative intrinsic
	binding enthalpy and negative heat capacity changes. The association
	constant is maximal at low pH (2 x 10(9) M-1 at pH 3) but decreases
	upon increasing pH (8.1 x 10(6) M-1 at pH 7). The binding of the
	inhibitor is coupled to the protonation of one of the aspartic moieties
	in the Asp dyad of the catalytic site of the protein. This phenomenon
	is responsible for the decrease in the apparent affinity of the inhibitor
	for the enzyme upon increasing pH. The experimental results presented
	here indicate that the binding of the inhibitor is favored both enthalpically
	and entropically. While the favorable enthalpic contribution is intuitively
	expected, the favorable entropic contribution is due to the large
	gain in solvent-related entropy associated with the burial of a large
	hydrophobic surface, that overcompensates the loss in conformational
	and translational/rotational degrees of freedom upon complex formation.
	The characteristics of the molecular recognition process have been
	evaluated by means of structure-based thermodynamic analysis. Three
	regions in the protein contribute significantly to the free energy
	of binding: the residues surrounding the Asp dyad (Asp32 in the N-terminal
	lobe and Asp215 in the C-terminal domain) and the flap region (Ile73
	to Asp77). In addition, the rearrangement of residues that are not
	in immediate contact with the inhibitor provides close to 40\% of
	the protease contribution to the binding free energy. On the other
	hand, the two statine residues provide more than half of the inhibitor
	contributions to the total free energy of binding. It is demonstrated
	that a previously developed empirical structural parametrization
	of the thermodynamic parameters that define the Gibbs energy, accurately
	accounts for the binding energetics and its temperature and pH-dependence.},

  abstract = {The heat capacity plays a major role in the determination of the energetics
	of protein folding and molecular recognition. As such, a better understanding
	of this thermodynamic parameter and its structural origin will provide
	new insights for the development of better molecular design strategies.
	In this paper we have analyzed the absolute heat capacity of proteins
	in different conformations. The results of these studies indicate
	that three major terms account for the absolute heat capacity of
	a protein: (1) one term that depends only on the primary or covalent
	structure of a protein and contains contributions from vibrational
	frequencies arising from the stretching and bending modes of each
	valence bond and internal rotations; (2) a term that contains the
	contributions of noncovalent interactions arising from secondary
	and tertiary structure; and (3) a term that contains the contributions
	of hydration. For a typical globular protein in solution the bulk
	of the heat capacity at 25 degrees C is given by the covalent structure
	term (close to 85\% of the total). The hydration term contributes
	about 15 and 40\% to the total heat capacity of the native and unfolded
	states, respectively. The contribution of non-covalent structure
	to the total heat capacity of the native state is positive but very
	small and does not amount to more than 3\% at 25 degrees C. The change
	in heat capacity upon unfolding is primarily given by the increase
	in the hydration term (about 95\%) and to a much lesser extent by
	the loss of noncovalent interactions (up to approximately 5\%).(ABSTRACT

  abstract = {Two effects are mainly responsible for the observed enthalpy change
	in protein unfolding: the disruption of internal interactions within
	the protein molecule (van der Waals, hydrogen bonds, etc.) and the
	hydration of the groups that are buried in the native state and become
	exposed to the solvent on unfolding. In the traditional thermodynamic
	analysis, the effects of hydration have usually been evaluated using
	the thermodynamic data for the transfer of small model compounds
	from the gas phase to water. The contribution of internal interactions,
	on the other hand, are usually estimated by subtracting the hydration
	effects from the experimental enthalpy of unfolding. The main drawback
	of this approach is that the enthalpic contributions of hydration,
	and those due to the disruption of internal interactions, are more
	than one order of magnitude larger than the experimental enthalpy
	value. The enthalpy contributions of hydration and disruption of
	internal interactions have opposite signs and cancel each other almost
	completely resulting in a final value that is over 10 times smaller
	than the individual terms. For this reason, the classical approach
	cannot be used to accurately predict unfolding enthalpies from structure:
	any error in the estimation of the hydration enthalpy will be amplified
	by a factor of 10 or more in the estimation of the unfolding enthalpy.
	Recently, it has been shown that simple parametric equations that
	relate the enthalpy change with certain structural parameters, especially
	changes in solvent accessible surface areas have considerable predictive
	power. In this paper, we provide a physical foundation to that parametrization
	and in the process we present a system of equations that explicitly
	includes the enthalpic effects of the packing density between the
	different atoms within the protein molecule. Using this approach,
	the error in the prediction of folding/unfolding enthalpies at 60
	degrees C, the median temperature for thermal unfolding, is better
	than +/- 3\% (standard deviation = 4 kcal/mol).},

	of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified
	size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the
	accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility
	of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides
	of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities
	are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin.
	Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of
	these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area
	of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical
	results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's
	radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the
	correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be
	used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in
	accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a
	hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native
	protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar
	(nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered
	separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more 'buried'
	in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes
	and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on
	folding tend to be highly variable.},

	the absence of a free energy barrier according to a battery of quantitative
	criteria in equilibrium experiments, including probe-dependent equilibrium
	unfolding, complex coupling between denaturing agents, characteristic
	DSC thermogram, gradual melting of secondary structure, and heterogeneous
	atom-by-atom unfolding behaviors spanning the entire unfolding process.
	Here, we present the results of nanosecond T-jump experiments probing
	backbone structure by IR and end-to-end distance by FRET. The folding
	dynamics observed with these two probes are both exponential with
	common relaxation times but have large differences in amplitude following
	their probe-dependent equilibrium unfolding. The quantitative analysis
	of amplitude and relaxation time data for both probes shows that
	BBL folding dynamics are fully consistent with the one-state folding
	scenario and incompatible with alternative models involving one or
	several barrier crossing events. At 333 K, the relaxation time for
	BBL is 1.3 micros, in agreement with previous folding speed limit
	estimates. However, late folding events at room temperature are an
	order of magnitude slower (20 micros), indicating a relatively rough
	underlying energy landscape. Our results in BBL expose the dynamic
	features of one-state folding and chart the intrinsic time-scales
	for conformational motions along the folding process. Interestingly,
	the simple self-averaging folding dynamics of BBL are the exact dynamic
	properties required in molecular rheostats, thus supporting a biological
	role for one-state folding.},

	compared with globular proteins, enabling them to function in a large

	can also have different folding mechanisms. Myotrophin comprises
	four ankyrin repeats stacked linearly to form an elongated structure.
	Using site-directed mutagenesis, we find that folding of wild-type
	myotrophin is initiated at the C-terminal repeats. However, close
	examination of the mutant chevron plots reveals that simple models
	are insufficient to describe all of the data, and double mutant analysis
	subsequently confirms that there are parallel folding pathways. Destabilizing
	mutations in the C-terminal repeats reduce flux through the wild-type
	pathway, making a new route accessible in which folding is initiated
	at the N-terminal repeats. Thus, the folding mechanism of the repeat
	protein is poised on a fulcrum: When one end of the molecule is perturbed,
	the balance shifts between the different nucleation sites. The vast
	majority of studies on small globular proteins indicate a single,
	well defined route between the denatured and native states. By contrast,
	the potential to initiate folding at more than one site may be a
	general feature of repeat proteins arising from the symmetry inherent

	it straightforward to direct the folding pathway of a repeat protein

	to predict the effect of single amino acid mutations at exposed locations
	in alpha-helices. The results have been used to derive a structure-based
	thermodynamic scale of alpha-helix propensities for amino acids.
	The structure-based thermodynamic analysis was performed for four
	different systems for which structural and experimental thermodynamic
	data are available: T4 lysozyme [Blaber et al (1994) J. Mol. Biol.235,
	600-624], barnase [Horovitz et al. (1992) J.Mol.Biol.227,560-568],

	the unfolded state. It is shown that a single set of structure/thermodynamic
	parameters accounts well for all the experimental data sets of helix
	propensities. For T4 lysozyme, the average value of the absolute

	0.11 kcal/mol, and for the synthetic peptide 0.08 kcal/mol. In addition,
	this approach predicts well the overall stability of the proteins
	and rationalizes the differences in alpha-helix propensities between
	amino acids. The excellent agreement observed between predicted and
	experimental delta G values for all amino acids validates the use
	of this structural parameterization in free energy calculations for
	folding or binding.},

	modules and a seventh partly disordered N-terminal ankyrin repeat
	sequence. Both the refolding and unfolding kinetics are best described
	as a sum of two exponential phases. The slow, minor refolding phase
	is limited by prolyl isomerization in the denatured state (D). The
	minor unfolding phase, which appears as a lag during fluorescence-detected
	unfolding, is consistent with an on-pathway intermediate (I). This
	intermediate, although not directly detected during refolding, is
	shown to be populated by interrupted refolding experiments. When
	plotted against urea, the rate constants for the major unfolding
	and refolding phases define a single non-linear v-shaped chevron,
	as does the minor unfolding phase. These two chevrons, along with
	unfolding amplitudes, are well-fitted by a sequential three-state
	model, which yields rate constants for the individual steps in folding
	and unfolding. Based on these fitted parameters, the D to I step
	is rate-limiting, and closely matches the major observed refolding
	phase at low denaturant concentrations. I appears to be midway between
	N and D in folding free energy and denaturant sensitivity, but has
	Trp fluorescence properties close to N. Although the Notch ankyrin
	domain has a simple architecture, folding is slow, with the limiting
	refolding rate constant as much as seven orders of magnitude smaller

  abstract = {When studying the set of biologically active peptides (the so-called
	peptidome) of a cell type, organ, or entire organism, the identification
	of peptides is mostly attempted by MS. However, identification rates
	are often dismally unsatisfactory. A great deal of failed or missed
	identifications may be attributable to the wealth of modifications
	on peptides, some of which may originate from in vivo post-translational
	processes to activate the molecule, whereas others could be introduced
	during the tissue preparation procedures. Preliminary knowledge of
	the modification profile of specific peptidome samples would greatly
	improve identification rates. To this end we developed an approach
	that performs clustering of mass spectra in a way that allows us
	to group spectra having similar peak patterns over significant segments.
	Comparing members of one spectral group enables us to assess the
	modifications (expressed as mass shifts in Dalton) present in a peptidome
	sample. The clustering algorithm in this study is called Bonanza,
	and it was applied to MALDI-TOF/TOF MS spectra from the mouse. Peptide
	identification rates went up from 17 to 36\% for 278 spectra obtained
	from the pancreatic islets and from 21 to 43\% for 163 pituitary
	spectra. Spectral clustering with subsequent advanced database search
	may result in the discovery of new biologically active peptides and
	modifications thereof, as shown by this report indeed.},

  abstract = {Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become the experimental method
	of choice for high-throughput proteomics-based biological discovery.
	The two primary ways of analyzing MS/MS data are database search
	and de novo sequencing. In this paper, we present a new approach
	to peptide de novo sequencing, called MSNovo, which has the following
	advanced features. (1) It works on data generated from both LCQ and
	LTQ mass spectrometers and interprets singly, doubly, and triply
	charged ions. (2) It integrates a new probabilistic scoring function
	with a mass array-based dynamic programming algorithm. The simplicity
	of the scoring function, with only 6-10 parameters to be trained,
	avoids the problem of overfitting and allows MSNovo to be adopted
	for other machines and data sets easily. The mass array data structure
	explicitly encodes all possible peptides and allows the dynamic programming
	algorithm to find the best peptide. (3) Compared to existing programs,
	MSNovo predicts peptides as well as sequence tags with a higher accuracy,
	which is important for those applications that search protein databases
	using the de novo sequencing results. More specifically, we show
	that MSNovo outperforms other programs on various ESI ion trap data.
	We also show that for high-resolution data the performance of MSNovo
	improves significantly. Supporting Information, executable files

  abstract = {For many decades, protein folding experimentalists have worked with
	no information about the time scales of relevant protein folding
	motions and without methods for estimating the height of folding
	barriers. Protein folding experiments have been interpreted using
	chemical models in which the folding process is characterized as
	a series of equilibria between two or more distinct states that interconvert
	with activated kinetics. Accordingly, the information to be extracted
	from experiments was circumscribed to apparent equilibrium constants
	and relative folding rates. Recent developments are changing this
	situation dramatically. The combination of fast-folding experiments
	with the development of analytical methods more closely connected
	to physical theory reveals that folding barriers in native conditions
	range from minimally high (approximately 14RT for the very slow folder
	AcP) to nonexistent. While slow-folding (i.e., > or = 1 ms) single-domain
	proteins are expected to fold in a two-state fashion, microsecond-folding
	proteins should exhibit complex behavior arising from crossing marginal
	or negligible folding barriers. This realization opens a realm of
	exciting opportunities for experimentalists. The free energy surface
	of a protein with a marginal (or no) barrier can be mapped using
	equilibrium experiments, which could resolve energetic factors from
	structural factors in folding. Kinetic experiments on these proteins
	provide the unique opportunity to measure folding dynamics directly.
	Furthermore, the complex distributions of time-dependent folding
	behaviors expected for these proteins might be accessible to single-molecule
	measurements. Here, we discuss some of these recent developments
	in protein folding, emphasizing aspects that can serve as a guide
	for experimentalists interested in exploiting this new avenue of
	research.},

	paradox. Microsecond-folding proteins are supposed to fold near or
	at the folding speed limit (downhill folding), but yet their folding
	behavior seems to comply with classical two-state analyses, which
	imply the crossing of high free energy barriers. However, close inspection
	of chemical and thermal denaturation kinetic experiments in fast-folding
	proteins reveals systematic deviations from two-state behavior. Using
	a simple one-dimensional free energy surface approach we find that
	such deviations are indeed diagnostic of marginal folding barriers.
	Furthermore, the quantitative analysis of available fast-kinetic
	data indicates that many microsecond-folding proteins fold downhill
	in native conditions. All of these proteins are then promising candidates
	for an atom-by-atom analysis of protein folding using nuclear magnetic
	resonance.1 We also find that the diffusion coefficient for protein
	folding is strongly temperature dependent, corresponding to an activation
	energy of approximately 1 kJ.mol-1 per protein residue. As a consequence,
	the folding speed limit at room temperature is about an order of
	magnitude slower than the approximately 1 micros estimates from high-temperature
	T-jump experiments. Our analysis is quantitatively consistent with
	the available thermodynamic and kinetic data on slow two-state folding
	proteins and provides a straightforward explanation for the apparent
	fast-folding paradox.},

	(i.e., maximal barrier < 3 RT) can resolve the folding process with
	atomic resolution [ Munoz ( 2002) Int. J. Quantum Chem. 90, 1522
	-1528] . Such information is extracted from hundreds of heterogeneous
	atomic equilibrium unfolding curves, which are characterized according
	to their denaturation midpoint (e.g., T m for thermal denaturation).
	Using statistical methods, we analyze T m accuracy when determined
	from the extremum of the derivative of the unfolding curve and from
	two-state fits under different sets of simulated experimental conditions.
	We develop simple procedures to discriminate between real unfolding
	heterogeneity at the atomic level and experimental uncertainty in
	the single T m of conventional two-state folding. We apply these
	procedures to the recently published multiprobe NMR experiments of
	BBL [ Sadqi et al. ( 2006) Nature 442, 317 -321 ] and conclude that
	for the 122 single transition atomic unfolding curves reported for
	this protein the mean T m accuracy is better than 1.8 K for both
	methods, compared to the 60 K spread in T m determined experimentally.
	Importantly, we also find that when the pre- or posttransition baseline
	is incomplete, the two-state fits systematically drift the estimated
	T m value toward the center of the experimental range. Therefore,
	the reported 60 K T m spread in BBL is in fact a lower limit. The
	derivative method is significantly less sensitive to this problem
	and thus is a better choice for multiprobe experiments with a broad
	T m distribution. The results we obtain in this work lay the foundations
	for the quantitative analysis of future multiprobe unfolding experiments

  abstract = {Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination
	of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native
	three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple
	protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process
	that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods
	therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach
	interprets changes in protein stability and/or folding kinetics,
	induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the
	native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics
	with structure, mutational methods have significant experimental
	uncertainties and are unable to map complex networks of interactions.
	In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding
	and the possibility of downhill folding. These theoretical predictions
	have been confirmed experimentally in recent years, including the
	observation of global downhill folding. However, a key remaining
	question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution
	analysis of protein folding processes. Here we show, with the use
	of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL
	from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined
	three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone
	and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view
	of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical
	nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding,
	hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy.
	From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in
	this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity.
	Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers
	(less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.},

	a scoring function that estimates the folding free energy of a protein
	sequence on a given main-chain structure. However, the computation
	of the conformational entropy in the folded state is generally an
	intractable problem, and its contribution to the free energy is not
	properly evaluated. In this article, we propose a new automated protein
	design methodology that incorporates such conformational entropy
	based on statistical mechanics principles. We define the free energy
	of a protein sequence by the corresponding partition function over
	rotamer states. The free energy is written in variational form in
	a pairwise approximation and minimized using the Belief Propagation
	algorithm. In this way, a free energy is associated to each amino
	acid sequence: we use this insight to rescore the results obtained
	with a standard minimization method, with the energy as the cost
	function. Then, we set up a design method that directly uses the
	free energy as a cost function in combination with a stochastic search
	in the sequence space. We validate the methods on the design of three
	superficial sites of a small SH3 domain, and then apply them to the
	complete redesign of 27 proteins. Our results indicate that accounting
	for entropic contribution in the score function affects the outcome
	in a highly nontrivial way, and might improve current computational

	(ESI), employs a traditional micro ESI source with supersonic nebulizing
	gas. The high linear velocity of the nebulizing gas provides efficient
	pneumatic spraying of the charged liquid sample. The variable electrostatic
	potential can be tuned to allow efficient and gentle ionization.
	This ionization method is successfully applied to aqueous solutions
	of various proteins at neutral pH, and its performance is compared
	to that of the nanospray and micro ESI techniques. Evidence for efficient
	desolvation during ESSI is provided by the fact that the peak widths
	for various multiply charged protein ions are an order of magnitude
	narrower than those for nanospray. Narrow charge-state distributions
	compared to other ESI techniques are observed also; for most of the
	proteins studied, more than 90\% of the protein ions can be accumulated
	in one charge state using ESSI when optimizing conditions. The fact
	that the abundant charge state is normally as low or lower than that
	recorded by ESI or nanospray indicates that folded protein ions are
	generated. The sensitivity of the ionization technique to high salt
	concentrations is comparable to that of nanospray, but ESSI is considerably
	less sensitive to high concentrations of organic additives such as
	glycerol or 2-amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol (Tris base).
	Noncovalent complexes are observed in the case of myoglobin, protein
	kinase A/ATP complex, and other proteins. The extent of dissociation
	of protein ions in ESSI is comparable to or even smaller than that
	in the case of nanospray, emphasizing the gentle nature of the method.
	The unique features of ESSI are ascribed to very efficient spraying
	and the low internal energy supplied to the ions. Evidence is provided
	that the method is capable of generating fully desolvated protein
	ions at atmospheric pressure. This allows the technique to be used
	for the study of ion-molecule reactions at atmospheric pressure and
	examples of this are shown.},

	intermediate in which the C-terminal half of the protein is structured

	terminus the mutation, the fewer repeats are structured in the intermediate;
	thus, structure in the intermediate frays from the site of the mutation.
	This behavior contrasts with the robust unfolding of globular proteins
	in which mutations can destabilize an intermediate but do not cause
	a different intermediate to be populated. We suggest that, for large
	repeat arrays, the energy landscape is very rough, with many different
	low-energy species containing varying numbers of folded modules so
	the species that dominates can be altered easily by single, conservative

  abstract = {Full-consensus designed ankyrin repeat proteins were designed with
	one to six identical repeats flanked by capping repeats. These proteins
	express well in Escherichia coli as soluble monomers. Compared to
	our previously described designed ankyrin repeat protein library,
	randomized positions have now been fixed according to sequence statistics
	and structural considerations. Their stability increases with length
	and is even higher than that of library members, and those with more
	than three internal repeats are resistant to denaturation by boiling
	or guanidine hydrochloride. Full denaturation requires their heating
	in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride. The folding and unfolding kinetics
	of the proteins with up to three internal repeats were analyzed,
	as the other proteins could not be denatured. Folding is monophasic,
	with a rate that is nearly identical for all proteins ( approximately
	400-800 s(-1)), indicating that essentially the same transition state
	must be crossed, possibly the folding of a single repeat. In contrast,
	the unfolding rate decreases by a factor of about 10(4) with increasing
	repeat number, directly reflecting thermodynamic stability in these
	extraordinarily slow denaturation rates. The number of unfolding
	phases also increases with repeat number. We analyzed the folding
	thermodynamics and kinetics both by classical two-state and three-state
	cooperative models and by an Ising-like model, where repeats are
	considered as two-state folding units that can be stabilized by interacting
	with their folded nearest neighbors. This Ising model globally describes
	both equilibrium and kinetic data very well and allows for a detailed
	explanation of the ankyrin repeat protein folding mechanism.},

  abstract = {Myotrophin is a 12.5 kDa protein that appears to have a key role in
	the initiation of cardiac hypertrophy, a central process in many
	heart diseases. Myotrophin primarily comprises ankyrin-like (ANK)
	repeats, the 33 amino acid motifs involved in a wide range of protein-protein
	interactions. As a first step in the structure-based search for cardiac
	hypertrophy antagonists and in order to gain insight into the molecular
	basis of action of the ubiquitous and multifunctional ANK repeat
	motif, we have determined the solution structure of myotrophin using
	multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.The myotrophin structure
	determination was based on 2786 experimental NMR restraints, and
	the precision of the coordinates for the final 45 simulated-annealing
	structures is 0.43 A for the backbone atoms and 0.87 A for all atoms.
	The structure of myotrophin is well defined and is ellipsoidal: approximately
	46 A long and 21 A wide. The ANK repeats, which constitute the main
	part of the myotrophin structure, are characteristic of a hairpin-like
	protruding tip followed by a helix-turn-helix motif. The V-shaped
	helix-turn-helix of the ANK repeats stack sequentially in bundles
	and are stabilized by compact hydrophobic cores, whereas the protruding
	tips are less ordered. This arrangement is quite different to the
	continuous beta-sheet topology observed in the corresponding regions
	of another ANK protein, 53BP2, the structure of which was determined
	in complex with p53.The solution structure of myotrophin provides
	important insights into the structural and dynamic features of the
	ANK motif, and suggests that the protruding tips with highly variable
	sequences may be critical to facilitate diverse protein-protein recognition.
	The present structure also provides a molecular basis for the further
	functional characterization of myotrophin and the development of
	therapeutics for hypertrophy-related heart diseases.},

  abstract = {The folding pathways of the B domain of protein A have been the subject
	of many experimental and computational studies. Based on a statistical
	mechanical model, it has been suggested that the native state symmetry
	leads to multiple pathways, highly dependent on temperature and denaturant
	concentration. Experiments, however, have not confirmed this scenario.
	By considering four nearly symmetrical proteins, one of them being
	the above molecule, here we show that, if contact energies are properly
	taken into account, a different picture emerges from kinetic simulations
	of the above-mentioned model. This is characterized by a dominant
	folding pathway, which is consistent with the most recent experimental
	results. Given the simplicity of the model, we also report on a direct
	sampling of the transition state.},
